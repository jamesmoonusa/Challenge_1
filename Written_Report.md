# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Knowing how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose
**Visualizing and Analyzing campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals**

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
May showing highest theater successful rate than other month of the years on theater category. 
As a result, May can be the best month to run a theater fundraising campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
There is decreasing successful percentage as funding goal increase and increasing fail percentage. Also slight increase of cancel rate.
We can concluded that there is correlation between funding Goals and outcomes
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
#### Challenges on Outcomes Based on Goals
Income should be highly correlated factor that affects fundraising outcomes. Since the campaign has run based on Country we should input each country’s GDP or household income data to see if this factor does change our outcome result. 
#### Challenges on Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Month of May’s high number of successful cases can miss leading from just high number of campaigns on May compare with other months. Simply comparing May total campaign is 166 while lowest number of campaign was 75 on Dec. So higher number of successful on May does not necessary means higher successful rate. So I have calculated successful ratio based on total. May shows 67% which is highest successful rate over years.  


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Month of May has Highest Successful Case and Highest Successful Rate based on total cases.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
As increasing Funding Goal amount increase, Successful rate decrease and fail rate increases.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Funding Goal out comes can have different result based country’s income. Result would have strong conclusion if we can add income data.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I have recreated Theater Outcomes successful rate based on each months Grant total cases to see actual successful rate on each month.
